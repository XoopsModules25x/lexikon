 * Class to define lexikon module constant values. These constants are
 * used to make the code easier to read and to keep values in central
 * location if they need to be changed.  These should not normally need
 * to be modified. If they are to be modified it is recommended to change
 * the value(s) before module installation. Additionally the module may not
 * work correctly if trying to upgrade if these values have been changed.
